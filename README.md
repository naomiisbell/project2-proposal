## What is your application?

A website where you can choose a photo from an API and put words on it to create a meme.

## What 3rd party API are you going to use?

https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes

## Expected roadblocks

1. to be able to change the style of how the user makes the meme like putting borders around it

2. I will probably learn firebase to figure out how the user can grab photos from their computer other than the API. 

3. I also want the user to be able to upload their memes
